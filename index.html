            <h2>Hey Mrs Munjiyah Muzhingi</h2>
            <p class="subtitle">(Ts sounds awesome when I say it 😭)</p>
            
            <p>I just created this and it took me like a lot of time to work out. My Friend Gemini will say it's easy, but of course he's AI, my assistant.</p>

            <p>But, I'm sorry for keeping you waiting and I would like you to know that I wanted to put all my imagination into this and my love just to make you feel special today. I don't really know why we celebrate Valentine's, because everyday is amazing when I'm with you. Just having you calls for a special occasion. Cauz you're special to me. But if I had control over time I would've made an app dedicated to you, but I can't (though I will 😈).</p>

            <p>I want to thank you for being mine. There's no possible way of thanking you enough. But I guess I thought ts would be a good enough try. I'm not intending to use this as an apology for whatever happened whatsoever. I just want you to know that you're special to me. I can't use words. I can't even use feelings. I'm growing and prolly losing touch of the person I once was. Unknowingly misinterpreting ts change as adaptation. But all that doesn't change anything.</p>

            <p class="signature">I love you, Fafa<br>
